Materials for my tesi.

# Actually, 🧐
if you are here it's probably because you want to use the `JDRPM` package, i.e. the Julia version of the [DRPM model](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.11542), developed by Page & friends, and somehow improved (in performances and in accounting for covariates) by my thesis work. Go ⭐[here](https://github.com/federicomor/Tesi/tree/main/src/JDRPM)⭐ to see how to setup it and have it ready-to-use in R.
